***************CONFIGURE SPECTRUM WIFI THROUGH ACS V2****************


Default: Spectrum Wifi Feature Disabled

Task: 1-

	Description:-Enable Spectrum Wifi Feature GRE Tunnel and spectrum SSID's  on default Configurations

Steps To Follow:-
		SetUp WAG Server
					1.With VLAN ID default 10 as on router(SSIDVlanID parameter of GRE Tunnel Object)


		Edit These Parameters from ACS
					1.Set Enable parameter of SpectrumWifi object in Device->Services to '1' to enable spectrum wifi specific scripts to run 
					2. Set Enable to '1' and LowerLayers of Interface Object inside GRE Tunnel Object
						eg:- Device.Ethernet.Interface.1.
						Note:- Provide '.' after instance number
					3.Set Enable to '1' and set RemoteEndpoints of Spectrum GRE Tunnel Object (gtun1)
					4.Enable SpectrumWiFi SSID's through AccessPoints object
					5.Apply these Changes

		Remarks:- network will restart, if Tunnel is up and Enabled everything works fine, connect client to spectrumwifi ssid's.

Task: 2:-

	Description:-To Disable SSID VLAN

Steps To Follow:-
		SetUp WAG Server
					1.Tear down previous configuration by stopping (for_wan_secure.sh) with the same configurations it was started
					2.Start the wag script (for_wan_secure.sh) without providing VLAN ID (which is -vid)

		Edit These Parameters from ACS
					1.Set SSIDVlanID parameter of AccessPoints object to 0 to Disable
					2.Apply these Changes

		Remarks:- network will restart if Tunnel is up and Enabled everything works fine,SSIDVLAN is disabled, connect client to spectrumwifi ssid's.

Task: 3:-

	Description:-Enable DHCP(IPv4) Snooper and LDRA(IPv6)

Steps To Follow:-
		SetUp WAG Server
					1.No changes to WAG

		Edit These Parameters from ACS
					1.To enable DHCP(IPv4) Snooper, Set 'DHCPSnooperIPv4Enable' parameter of SpectrumWifi object to 1 to Enable
					1.To enable LDRA(IPv6), Set 'LDRAIPv6Enable' parameter of SpectrumWifi object to 1 to Enable
					2.Apply these Changes

		Remarks:-Network will restart when both or either one of the feature is enabled. When a DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 client tries to acquier IPv4 and IPv6 
		IP Addresses,the Ciruit-ID and the Interface ID goes as a DHCP options(Option 82 for DHCPv4 and Options 18 for DHCPv6) to the server respectively.
		These options can be seen in wireshark at the WAG server interface.


Task: 4:-

	Description:-Enable GRE KeepAlive

Steps To Follow:-
		SetUp WAG Server
					1.No changes to WAG

		Edit These Parameters from ACS
					1.To enable GREKeeplive for GRE Tunnels set 'KeepAlivePolicy' parameter of Gre Tunnel object to 'icmp'
					2.Apply these Changes

		Remarks:- network will restart , while keepalive starts it presumes SSID's and primary endpoint of tunnel are Up and enabled, if keepalive are sent
		and received everything works fine connect client to pectrumWiFi SSID's, If Keepalive are not received then tunnel wil get disable and ssid's will 
		turn down.
Keepive keeps on working and check if Endpoint is Up and rechable then tunnel will get enabled and SSID's will turn Up.

Task: 5:-

	Description:-Set Upstream QOS Mark for GRE Tunnel

Steps To Follow:-
		SetUp WAG Server
					1.No changes to WAG

		Edit These Parameters from ACS
					1.To set Upstream QOS Mark for GRE Tunnels set 'DefaultDSCPMark' parameter of GRE tunnel object. eg: CS7
					2.Apply these Changes

		Remark:- spectrum_qos will restart and apply the changes in mangle table for upstream mark. It can be seen at other end on Wireshark in 'DSCP Section' of IP header with source IP of gre tunnel on router and destination Ip present and rechable on WAG side for the tunnel from router.

Task: 6:-

	Description:-Enable AssociationRSSIThreshold for SpectrumWifi SSID's

Steps To Follow:-
		SetUp WAG Server
					1.No changes to WAG

		Edit These Parameters from ACS
					1.To enable Association RSSI Threshold for Spectrum Wifi SSID set 'AssociationRSSIThreshold' parameter of AccessPoints, to any value between 1 and 100 , to disable set 0
					2.Apply these Changes

		Remark:- spectrum public ssid will only accept connection request's which has rssi value above AssociationRSSIThreshold. No client can be associated with public ssid if it has rssi value below AssociationRSSIThreshold. 

Task: 7:-

	Description:-Disable SpectrumWifi feature

Steps To Follow:-
		SetUp WAG Server
					1.No changes to WAG

		Edit These Parameters from ACS
					1.To disable SpectrumWifi Feature (which will disable GRE Tunnel,SpectrumWifi Public SSID's) set Enable  parameter of SpectrumWifi Object to 0
					2.Apply these Changes

		Remark:- network will restart on disabling tunnel keepalive policy will be set to none and ssid's will be turned down.


Note :- All above mentioned steps are for IPv4 . Similary apply for IPv6
