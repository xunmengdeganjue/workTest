1. When Vlan is enabled in SpectrumWifi with Remote End Points
   of IPV4

	Run the script "for_vlan_secure.sh" for Secure SSID's 
	of 2g and 5g Spectrum

	eg -> ./for_vlan_secure.sh start 		-----------------to START
	eg -> ./for_vlan_secure.sh stop 		-----------------to STOP

	Run the script "for_vlan_clear.sh" for Clear SSID's 
	of 2g and 5g Spectrum

	eg -> ./for_vlan_clear.sh start 		-----------------to START
	eg -> ./for_vlan_clear.sh stop 		        -----------------to STOP

	And Run Script "vlanip.sh" to assign IP's to the
	interface if required for primary and secondary of 
	secure as well as clear tunnels End Points

2. When Vlan is enabled in SpectrumWifi with Remote End Points
   of IPV6

        Run the script "for_vlan_secure.sh" for Secure SSID's 
        of 2g and 5g Spectrum

        eg -> ./for_vlan_secure.sh start 6              -----------------to START
        eg -> ./for_vlan_secure.sh stop 6               -----------------to STOP

	Run the script "for_vlan_clear.sh" for Clear SSID's 
	of 2g and 5g Spectrum

	eg -> ./for_vlan_clear.sh start 6        	-----------------to START
	eg -> ./for_vlan_clear.sh stop 	6	        -----------------to STOP

        And Run Script "vlanip6.sh" to assign IP's to the
        interface if required for primary and secondary of 
        secure as well as clear tunnels End Points



	****NOTE:- For vlan
		If you want to STOP please STOP both script
		if both are running at the same time
		for same mode ( i.e IPV4 or IPV6 ) and then 
		Run for both or only one as your requirement.

		*********************************************

		Restart Chilli if you change Mode ( i.e IPV4 or IPV6 )
		or vice versa

3. Same things to be done with wan scripts to get things done
   with wan IPV4 and IPV6.
